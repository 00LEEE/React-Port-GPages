# React-Portfolioüìú
 - Built a React portfolio as a good intro to my experience using react. Very different and very versitile comparably speaking of course. Personally I found that making this using react was a whole lot easier than doing it in HTML & JS. I didnt have to write near as many lines of code as I did with my first portfolio.

# Built Using üöß
- HTML 
- CSS 
- Figma
- React
- JavaScript 

# Trials I Experienced ü§¨
- Making sure the Imports on every page were input correctly. 
- Creating the Virtical Timeline was a little difficult; I have never attempted a design method such as that.
- Embedding links inside each of the social icons as well as the Email icon specifically; that one was a little more difficult as I have never linked my email anywhere other than a "Contact Me" section on my normal portfolio using HTML & JS. Ultimately I got things done and it turned out really well I think.

Deployed website on Github: https://00leee.github.io/React-Portfolio/
*Note - Had to create seperate repo for publishing on Github Pages please visit: "https://github.com/00LEEE/React-PortfolioCode" for code.

# Continued Devolopment:
- Add links to all my projects not just placholders. Some of my projects are broken right now and need a little fixing so I decided to wait on them until I fix them.
- Add more experience as I gain it along with continued education if I take any other classes/courses.
